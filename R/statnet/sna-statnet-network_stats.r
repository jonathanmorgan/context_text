# First, need to load SNA functions and load data into statnet network object.
#    For more details on that, see the files "functions-sna.r",
#    "sna-load_data.r" and "sna-statnet_init.r".
#
# assumes that working directory for statnet is sourcenet/R/statnet.
# setwd( ".." )
# source( "functions-sna.r" )
# source( "sna-load_data.r" )
# setwd( "statnet" )
# source( "sna-statnet-init.r" )

# results in:
# results in (among other things):
# - humanNetworkData - data frame with human-generated network data matrix in it, including columns on the right side for any node-specific attributes.
# - calaisNetworkData - data frame with computer-generated network data matrix in it, including columns on the right side for any node-specific attributes.
# - humanNetworkTies - data frame with only human-generated network data matrix in it, no node-specific attributes.
# - calaisNetworkTies - data frame with only computer-generated network data matrix in it, no node-specific attributes.
# - humanNetworkMatrix - matrix with only human-generated network data matrix in it, no node-specific attributes.
# - calaisNetworkMatrix - matrix with only computer-generated network data matrix in it, no node-specific attributes.
# - humanNetworkStatnet - statnet network with human-coded network in it.
# - calaisNetworkStatnet - statnet network with computer-coded network in it.

# Also, be advised that statnet and igraph don't really play nice together.
#    If you'll be using both, best idea is to have a workspace for each.
